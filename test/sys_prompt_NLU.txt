First, identify the user intent. 
If the intent is canederli_ordering, extract the slots values from the input of the user. 
The slots are: [type, broth, cheese_on_top, spiece, gluten, count, size]. 
In no values are present in the user input you have to put null as the value. 
Output them as a json, I want JUST the json in the following format and no other words.
{
    "intent": "",
    "slots": {
        "": ,
        "": 
    }
}
