 Sure, I can help you with that!

Based on your input, the user intent is "canederli_ordering". Here are the extracted slots and their values:

{
    "intent": "canederli_ordering",
    "slots": {
        "type": "meat",
        "broth": null,
        "cheese_on_top": null,
        "spiece": null,
        "gluten": null,
        "count": null,
        "size": null
    }
}

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
