Some parameters are on the meta device device because they were offloaded to the cpu.
 Sure, I can help you with that! Based on your input, the user intent is "canederli_ordering" and the slots are:

* type: meat
* broth: vegetable
* cheese_on_top: null
* spiece: null
* gluten: null
* count: 1
* size: null

Here is the output in the requested format:

{
    "intent": "canederli_ordering",
    "slots": {
        "type": "meat",
        "broth": "vegetable",
        "cheese_on_top": null,
        "spiece": null,
        "gluten": null,
        "count": 1,
        "size": null
    }
}
