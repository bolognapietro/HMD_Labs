Some parameters are on the meta device device because they were offloaded to the cpu.
 As the Dialogue Manager, I understand that you have received an input from the NLU component with the following slots:

* canederli_type: meat
* canederli_broth: null
* canederli_cheese_on_top: null
* canederli_spiece: null
* canederli_gluten: null
* canederli_count: null
* canederli_size: null

Based on the input, I determine that one or more slots are missing values (null). Therefore, the best action to take is to request information for the missing slots using the `request_info` action.

Here is the action I will take:

* `request_info(slot="canederli_broth")`

I will now prompt the user to provide the value for the `canederli_broth` slot.
