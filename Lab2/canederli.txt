First, identify the user intent.
If the intent is canederli_ordering, extract the slots values from the input of the user.
The slots are: [canederli_type, canederli_broth, canederli_cheese_on_top, canederli_spiece, canederli_gluten, canederli_count, canederli_size].
In no values are present in the user input you have to put null as the value.
Output them as a json.
